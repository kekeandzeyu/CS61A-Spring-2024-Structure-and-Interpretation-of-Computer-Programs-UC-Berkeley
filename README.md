## 1. The Purpose of this Repository

  As a student who is currently studying this stduying this course, when I
  meet with difficulties, I will try to solve them. But usually it can 
  take a lot of time to figure out the solutions to the problems. Thinking 
  of this, I decide to share my solutions in this repository. They may not 
  be correct, so hopefully you can help me correct them.
